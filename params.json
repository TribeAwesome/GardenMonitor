{"name":"Gardenmonitor","tagline":"A system for monitoring a garden with many sensors","body":"### Welcome to Garden Monitor Pages.\r\nA system for monitoring a garden with many sensors\r\n\r\nCurrently we use a ChipKit Uno (Arduino like) board to collect data from a set os sensors installed in the garden. This is, in turn, connected to a Raspberry Pi (or eventually a BeagleBone) which parses the data and stuffs it into a MySQL database. This database is updated everytime there is a new sample from the sensors. The data is then displayed on a webpage using HighCharts, which can show the data updating live.\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is a project of \r\n@tjteru and @widakay\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
